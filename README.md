# HiBON Specification 
This document contains the first draft of the HiBON data format including specification for HiRPC and HiBON Record specification.

HiBON stands for Hash invariant Binary Object Notation and is inspired by BSON but is not compatible with BSON.

The HiBON format will secure that the an data object store the same information will result in the same binary data and therefor will result in the same hash value.

This is specially used full for distributed system where same data object is generated by each node in the network. The node can the proof that it they have the same data by signing the hash of  the data and reveal the signature to the other node with reveal the data or the hash of the data.

This property of the HiBON format is used extensively in the Tagion network to keep the distributed database updated.

The specification for converting between JSON and HiBON is also include.
